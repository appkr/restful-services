This post is not an invention, but is a gathering of best practices and insights provided by many across the community.

# What is API
As per Wikipedia: An Application Programming Interface (API) is a specification intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other. 

# What is REST
[REST is a set of principles] (http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction) that define how Web standards, such as HTTP and URIs, are supposed to be used (which often differs quite a bit from what many people actually do). REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and was first described in chapter 5 of Roy Fielding's Ph.D dissertation.
